# MI5 Tech Test

As part of an interview process I was asked to create a simple application based of a spec which had to be mobile friendly and follow a set of requirements.

I was asked not to use any libraries / frameworks to do this test but was allowed to use libraries / tools for building and testing purposes

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and git installed on your machine.

### Installing

To get the project up and running on your local machine, you will need to follow these steps:

Clone the repo

````
$ git clone https://github.com/banterstudios/MI5-tech-test.git
```

Install all dependancies

```
$ npm install
```

Run on local host

```
$ npm run start
```

This will now be running on your local host so go to 

```
localhost:8888
```

## Deployment

For deployment, run

```
$ npm run production
```

Everything inside the dist folder will need to be uploaded to your live website.
